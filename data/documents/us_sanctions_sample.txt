The United States imposes economic sanctions against foreign countries, entities, and individuals. These sanctions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC sanctions can be either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to accomplish foreign policy and national security goals.
