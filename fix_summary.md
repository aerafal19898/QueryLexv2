# Fernet Key Fix Summary

The error 'ValueError: Fernet key must be 32 url-safe base64-encoded bytes' was fixed with the following changes:

1. Modified app/config.py to generate a proper Fernet key:
   - Added 'generate_fernet_key()' function that creates a URL-safe base64-encoded 32-byte key
   - Changed DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY to use this function if not provided in environment

2. Updated app/utils/encryption.py:
   - Improved the _initialize_key method to handle different key formats
   - Added support for string representations of bytes literals

3. Modified app/main.py:
   - Added debug output to show encryption key source
   - Improved error handling for key initialization

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- test_fernet.py - Tested Fernet key generation and encryption/decryption
- test_document_encryption.py - Tested DocumentEncryption class initialization
- test_main_import.py - Tested importing app.main module

## Additional Notes
- To fully run the application, several dependencies need to be installed
- Installation commands:
  

The encryption key issues is fixed, but running the full application requires installing more dependencies.
